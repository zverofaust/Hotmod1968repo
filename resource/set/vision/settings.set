;/*=============== Line of sight visualization ===============*/

; // Display of the line of sight on the units. The line of sight displayed corresponds to the distance at which A SPECIFIC PROP IS DETECTED. It doesn't represent the max vision of your soldier. Units could be spotted beyond the line of sight display. Likewise, you need to be real close to stealth soldiers to be able to spot them within your line of sight display

{ranges
	{human   ; // first brighter vision range displayed. This is deprecated.
		{human}

	{vehicle          ; // main vision range displayed. 
		{cannon_00}   ; // The vision range displayed is far enough to detect this prop if it comes within the range.
