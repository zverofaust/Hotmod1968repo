v0.2

Big changes coming.

- Revamped UI, new vehicle damage profile views, new main menu background; infantry changed to show helmet in profile fiew (bottom left);
- New units/weapons (may or may not actually be implemented):
	- IS-2M (unused, for 1950s)
	- IS-3M (Soviet Conquest tree)
	- ISU-152K, ISU-122M and ISU-152M (replace existing WW2 copies)
	- LARS 1 (West German artillery doctrine)
	- ACH-47A Guns-a-Go-Go (US Aircav Helicopter sortie)
	- MAN 630 (West German medium truck)
	- UH-1B "Frog" with M5 grenade launcher armament subsystem (US Aircav Helicopter sortie)
	- West German DM34 Handflammpatrone (basically an M72 LAW that shoots napalm)

- Fixes:
	- FINALLY fixed enemy attack direction arrows appearing on minimap during Conquest battles
	- Finally was able to fix up armor volumes on a few tanks, notable M48s and T-10s; M48s in particular should be much better protected frontally now
	- Various other fixes, I don't remember them all and I'm terrible at keeping track

- Other little things like MVD caps, Chinese civilian caps, new Polish 'enumerator' font, etc

Some of these new units haven't been added to Conquest trees, they will be soon, I'm just strapped for time and trying to rush a release.
