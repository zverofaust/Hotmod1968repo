v0.08

Happy New Year everyone! We have been motivated by GOH's updates that brought special squads in the squad menu for every doctrine, so of course we had to take it one step further. We've heavily revamped how doctrines are implemented so that doctrine-specific units can now be found spread out in all menus, not just the Doctrine menu, and be purchased with MP instead of DP. Each doctrine will still have a core of universally shared squads, weapons and vehicles common to every doctrine, but these will be relatively light and unremarkable units - basically everything up to Light Tanks, mortars and recoilless weapons/light AT emplacements.

What this means is that each doctrine will now overall have drastically different selections of units, many of which aren't found anywhere else. Of course, all the truly special Doctrine-unique units will still be in the Doctrine menu available only for Doctrine Points.

This is a work in progress design and we'll undoubtedly need to tweak it for balancing, so please report how your games are going!

Log:

- As explained above, revamped doctrine systems to spread doctrine-specific units into different menus as well as a bunch of rebalancing and refactoring;
- Basic doctrine infantry squads (USMC, US Cav, VDV etc) now available for purchase with MP in the standard Infantry Squad menu for most doctrines;
- Exception to this is China, who has Militia, Conscripts and a basic Volunteers squad available to all doctrines and no common advanced infantry for any doctrine;
- Condensed a few doctrines - the two USMC doctrines have been combined back into one, and the Soviet Spetsnaz and Red Banner doctrines have been dismantled and their units spread to other doctrines (mostly VDV and Independent Tank, respectively);
- China now has Northern (Catalogue A), Southern (Catalogue B), and Artillery doctrines;
- West Germany now has a dilapidated Artillery doctrine with a few heavy guns of US origin;
- Chinese infantry types have been reorganized into Militia, Conscripts, Volunteers and Veterans, with "Special Soldiers" serving as scouts and infiltrators;
- Polish OTK doctrine retooled into 'Praski Pu≈Çk Zmechanizowany', or Prague Mechanized Regiment, which will be a balanced doctrine focused on (regular) mechanized troops and tanks;
- Artillery callins are now back in the Offmap Callins menu and have been reduced to Smoke, Light, Medium and Heavy bombardments, with the latter two available only to Artillery doctrines;
- Aircraft callins reduced to Medium and Napalm/WP for most;
- Command Vehicles removed & are no longer required for offmap callins;

Other changes not directly related to the above changes:

- A few US weapons adopting new firing sounds from their counterparts in Liberation DLC;
- Added Chinese Type 56 Recoilless Rifle, a copy of the American M20 from examples captured in Korea;
- Fix TP cameras for American SPGs
