v0.08

Happy New Year everyone! We have been motivated by GOH's updates that brought special squads in the squad menu for every doctrine, and in true Hotmod fashion, we had to take it one step further. We've heavily revamped how we implement doctrines so that doctrine units can now be found spread out in all menus, not just the Doctrine menu, and be purchased with MP instead of DP. Each doctrine will still have a core of universally shared squads, weapons and vehicles, but these will be relatively light and unremarkable units - basically everything up to Light Tanks, mortars and recoilless weapons/light AT emplacements.

What this means is that each doctrine will now overall have drastically different selections of units, many of which aren't found anywhere else. Of course, all the truly special Doctrine-unique units will still be in the Doctrine menu available only for Doctrine Points.

This is a work in progress design and we'll undoubtedly need to tweak it for balancing, so please report how your games are going!

Log:

- As explained above, revamped doctrine systems to spread doctrine-specific units into different menus;
- Basic doctrine infantry squads (USMC, US Cav, VDV etc) now available in standard Infantry Squad menu for MP;
- Exception to this is China, who has Militia, Conscripts and a basic Volunteers squad available to all doctrines;
- Condensed a few doctrines to shed excess - the two USMC doctrines have been combined into one USMC doctrine, and the Soviet Spetsnaz and Red Banner doctrines have been dismantled and their units spread to other doctrines (mostly VDV and Independent Tank doctrines);
- China now has Northern, Southern, and Artillery doctrines;
- West Germany now has a dilapidated Artillery doctrine with a few American heavy guns;
- Chinese infantry has been organized thusly: Militia, armed primarily with pre-WW2 weapons like Mosins, PPsh and DP MGs; Conscripts, 'obligated soldiers' who have been drafted into the PLA; Volunteers who had voluntarily joined the PLA; Veterans, who have survived war long enough to be tenured and effective soldiers; and finally Special Soldiers, the few given special training for infiltration, sabotage, assassination and other clandestine missions;
